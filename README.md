# Data-Analytics-Assignment-1
This dataset collected from cooperative autonomous driving scenarios using V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) communication in a VANET (Vehicular Ad Hoc Network) environment. It comprises 2300 records with real-time multi-agent data including GPS coordinates, LiDAR, radar, and camera outputs, along with network communication metrics such as latency, packet delivery ratio, and throughput.

The dataset reflects realistic VANET conditions by introducing packet drops and communication delays, enabling research in robust perception, decision-making, and prediction models under interrupted communication. It includes target variables like collision detection, obstacle detection accuracy, and decision accuracy, useful for evaluating intelligent communication-aware driving frameworks.

Key Features:

Multi-sensor agent data (LiDAR, radar, camera)

V2X communication logs (latency, drop rates, throughput)

Real-time GPS and timestamped coordination

Targets for collision, perception, and decision performance
